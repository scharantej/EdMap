Certainly, let's design a Flask application to create a website that lists different education philosophies and schools within a city that follow those philosophies. Below is the design for the application:

## HTML Files
### 1. `index.html`:
- Serves as the landing page
- Contains a list of different education philosophies
- Each education philosophy links to a separate page dedicated to that philosophy

### 2. `philosophy.html`:
- Dedicated to a specific education philosophy
- Displays a list of schools located in the city that follow the specific education philosophy

### 3. `schools.html`:
- Displays detailed information about a particular school, such as address, contact information, and perhaps a brief history

## Routes
### 1. `index`:
- This route renders the `index.html` file
- Displays the main page with a list of education philosophies

### 2. `philosophy/<philosophy_name>`:
- This dynamic route accepts a philosophy name as an argument.
- Example: `philosophy/progressive`
- It renders the `philosophy.html` file and displays a list of schools in the city that follow the specified education philosophy.

### 3. `schools/<school_id>`:
- This dynamic route accepts a school ID as an argument.
- Example: `schools/123`
- It renders the `schools.html` file and displays detailed information about the school with the specified ID.

This Flask application provides a user-friendly interface to explore different education philosophies, find nearby schools that follow a particular philosophy, and learn more about each school's details.
